# .emacs.d
My custom .emacs.d configuration.  Evil/avy-focused interactive editing.  Mostly setup for python/web at the moment.

Clone this into your .emacs.d folder to use my settings, if you want to for some reason.

If you don't know what .emacs.d is, this is probably not the best configuration to use; I'd recommend looking at DOOM emacs, or roll your own using https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs, honey, and just a daub of peanut butter.
